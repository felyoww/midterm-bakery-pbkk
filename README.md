### Project Explanation

For our Laravel Final Project, our group developed a web application modeled after an E-Commerce platform, which we named "Atherial Bakery." This project is designed as an online bakery shop, offering users a seamless and interactive experience when browsing through a wide variety of bakery products. Customers can explore different menu catalogs, featuring detailed product descriptions, images, and prices. For those interested in making a purchase, a user-friendly checkout system has been integrated, which is accessible upon logging in as a customer.

What sets this project apart is the dual point-of-view approach, allowing access for both customers and admin. Customers can enjoy a straightforward shopping experience, while administrators are provided with tools to manage the platform efficiently. As admins, they can add and categorize new product types, ensuring the menu remains up-to-date. They also have access to manage customer orders by tracking the delivery and payment statuses, enabling smoother operations from behind the scenes.

By blending these essential e-commerce features with a polished user interface, "Atherial Bakery" provides an appealing and functional platform for both customers and administrators, designed to enhance the overall experience of running and interacting with an online bakery.
